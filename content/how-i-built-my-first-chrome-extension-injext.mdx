Welcome to my first blog post, Without further delay lets talk about the idea "Injext" and how we turned this small idea into a chrome extension.

## The Idea

So when I was applying for internships and jobs as a student I found the job application part repetitive. There were similar questions in all of them like "Tell us about yourself", "Proudest project", "A cover letter" etc. So I wrote my answers and stored them in a github repository. Now with the 
help of github's api and a browser extension I can directly insert any 
my texts into html forms.

Code: [Injext-Extension](https://github.com/PDROJACK/injext-extension/tree/main/src)

Extension: [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/injext/nbfdkbclppodpkkgbpmagnfenhhoihnd?hl=en)

Demo: [video](https://youtu.be/-M6LBbsQG2g)

## Step 1: Learning how extensions work

> I will be talking about building a chrome extension as the documentation was good

The main part of chrome extension is <b>manifest.json</b> file. In this file, you
specify permissions you need from client, permissions you need from chrome 
and other things like content scripts and background scripts.

Lets talk about content scripts and background scripts first. 

Background scripts in chrome are like entrypoint of a chrome extensions. 
In these scripts, we can setup our extension and do stuff required 
at the startup or one time tasks required to be done once an extension is installed by a user.
They have access to all the chrome api's.

Content scripts are scripts with restricted access to chrome api and can be setup to
activate on specific URLs. They can be used to access a tab's DOM and modify it. But to 
fulfill its task it might require other chrome api's as well and to do this it 
has to communicate with background scripts. This concept is called Message Passing.
Both content scripts and background scripts have access to message passing APIs.

You can think of it as a Client-Server model.

Below is the manifest.json file of injext, you can specify your content-scripts and 
the url it will get executed on, in our case it will work on all websites.

Similarly, background script is specified in service_worker field.

``` json
\\ manifest.json
{
  "name": "injext",
  "version": "1.1",
  "description": "Fill forms using git repository",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "./popup.html"
  },
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts" : [ 
    { 
      "matches": ["https://*/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"] 
    } 
  ],
  "icons": {
    "128":"icon128.png",
    "48":"icon48.png",
    "16":"icon16.png"
  },
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab", "contextMenus"],
  "host_permissions": ["https://api.github.com/"]
}
```

Other useful property is action.default_popup. Here your extension popup html is specified.

Now coming to permissions and host_permissions, these are crucial fields and require you to declare 
permissions for chrome api's you are strictly using in you extension. Taking permissions for extra
api's you are not using might lead to rejection from chrome developer store review So be careful.

host_permissions are hosts your extension is making http calls to. In our case,
we are calling github's api.

## Step 2: Developing our idea 

The design is to provide a context-menu ( menu when you right click in browser ) when 
you right click in a text input with the files in the base directory of your github repo as menu items.
When you click on any menu item, its contents will be pasted in the text input.

There are three fetch calls:

1. Http call that takes github repo url and links it with chrome extension
2. Http call to make context menu from provided repository
3. Http call to get contents when a context menu item is clicked


First, call is to made from popup.html, where user will put a valid github repo url and 
we will save that url in chrome storage. Next we send message to background.js to create a 
context menu by fetching the repository items.

```js
\\ popup.js
const API = "https://api.github.com";

const clickkk = function sendRepo() {

  let repo = document.getElementById("text-input").value;

  if (repo.split(".").pop() === "git") {

    const data = repo.split("/")
    const user = data.at(-2)
    const repoName = data.at(-1).split(".").at(0)

    fetch(API+`/repos/${user}/${repoName}`, {
          method: "GET",
          mode: "cors",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
          }}
        ).then(async (response) => {
          const res = await response.json();
          if(!res.private){
            chrome.storage.sync.set({ repo }, ()=>{
              inputArea.style.display = "none";
              changeRepo.style.display = "inline";

              chrome.runtime.sendMessage({action: "link"}, function(r) {
                console.log(r);
              });

            })
          }
      }).catch(err => console.log(err));
    
    } else {
      alert("Invalid URL please enter again");
  }
}

inputButton.addEventListener("click", clickkk);
```

In the code, we are checking if repo is public, then we send message to background script to 
link our repo and create a context menu.

```js
\\ background.js
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function (req, sender, sendRes) {
  
  if (req.action === "link") {
      setupContextMenu();
  }

});
```

The third call uses content.js (content script), we have added an event listener on each context menu item
whenever user clicks on a menu item, background.js will fetch the contents tranform then into ascii
and puts it in current text input value by sending a message to the active tabs content script.
Thats pretty much how injext works.

```js
\\ background.js
chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, async function () {
  
  const res = await getTemplateData(
    local_cache.username,
    local_cache.repoName,
    [info.parentMenuItemId, info.menuItemId]
  );

  chrome.tabs.sendMessage(selectedTab.id, { res }, function (response) {
    console.log("success");
  });

});
```

The background script above fetches the data depending on the menu item clicked
and sends it to the active tabs content script.

The content script receives the message and sets the text input value.

```js
\\ content.js
if (!chrome.runtime.onMessage.hasListeners()) {

  chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(
    (request, sender, sendResponse) => {
      document.activeElement.value = request.res;
      sendResponse(true);
    },
  );

}
```

I have only used couple of apis but There are so many chrome apis that are yet 
to be explored. You can get the full code from my github.

Thank you for reading. I'll be back soon.
